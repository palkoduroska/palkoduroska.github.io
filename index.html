	<h1>Explainer page </h1>

	<p align="justify">The dataset has size 673 MB and contains flight connections between all airports in the USA throughout year 2008. The dataset provides 29 variables, however not all of them are used for the visualization. When we were looking for inspiration, we saw visualizations of flight data which seemed to be a great opportunity to apply skills we have learnt in this course. Nonetheless, none of these visualizations told a story about delays. For this reason, we decided to tell this important story! Moreover, a desire to crush relatively big dataset convinced us to choose this one, composing of roughly 7 million observations.</p>   
        <p align="justify">The goal of the visualization is to allow users to interactively explore information about flights and arrival and departure delays in the top 30 airports of the US. Therefore, we give the user the ability to select specific airports, dates and minutes of delay; providing then the distribution of the delay in the hours of the day via a bar-chart. </p> 
	<p align="justify">Cleaning of the data was very simple due to high quality of the information. However, it was necessary to remove incorrect observations containing missing values. This procedure was followed by the filtering of the top 30 airports since the original ~3000 airports would not make the visualization user friendly and would result in too many connections. Initially, we had information about 7.009.728 flights for 2008. After filtering, the 33,71% of the flights remained, which is quite a lot considering we are taking only 1% of the airports. Treating more than 2.000.000 flights with javascript and D3 would still provide a slow user experience, therefore, we decidied to aggregate the data. Instead of using the information for every flight individually, we stored the number of flights in each connection in and hourly resolution. This resulted in a much smaller dataset that allows for fast interaction in D3.</p>
	
	
	<p align="justify">We have decided to use Partitioned poster genre which is, according to our opinion, the most suitable for this kind of visualization. It allows user to see many features and interactions while exploring the visualization. In the visualization, the following tools from Visual Narrative are used: Consistent visual platform (It does not change, only filtering), Feature distinction (selecting on timeline, choose between delay duration) and Animated transitions (transitions in the bar-chart). Also, the following tools from Narrative Structure are used: User directed path, Hoovering Highlighting (hoovering over airports and lines), Filtering/Selection (by brushing timeline, clicking buttons and selecting dropdowns) and Introductory text. Overall, we found this tools to be the most helpful and intuitive for the best user understanding and experience. They provide, in our opinion, the right amount of user interaction without being too complex and difficult to understand. On the other hand, they are sophiticated enough to provide more information than a non-interactive visualization.</p>
	<p align="justify">Initially, we had a database with 7.009.728 number of flights in 2008. The information was a lot, so we decided to reduce it choosing the most important airports in the country. In particular, we chose 30 airports, which contains 33,71% of the database. Furthermore, we cleaned the information, aggregating it to have the number of flights per hour, independently from the minutes. Finally, we removed those variables we had decided not to use in our visualization in order to make processes as fast as possible.</p>

	<p align="justify">The visualization itself and how it works are already explained in the introductory text of the Data Story. Mainly, the visualization consists of a map of the US containing the most frequented airports with information on the number of flights and their connections. It also contains a timeline to brush specific dates and a bar chart to get delay information. The combination of all the features mentioned above allow the user to easily access the information about which airport, airport connection, month and hour is the most prone to present delays. So it can be helpful for people interested in traveling around the USA.</p>
	<p align="justify">We are highly satisfied with the visualization we have created. We have accomplished all goals we set in the video from Project Assignment A (which were not few). We have, in addition, implemented some extra features like the delay ratios and the minute dropdowns. However, we are aware that some other components could have been added. For example, the reason of the delays (which is in the dataset but mostly missing), or the airplane model (which we could not find). Adding a bar chart showing the number of cancelled flights per airport might have been a good improvement to our visualization, but we decided to stick with delays. Finally, making the map brushable to select airports could also have been a good choice.</p>
